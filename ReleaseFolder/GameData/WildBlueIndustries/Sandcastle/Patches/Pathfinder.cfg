// Adds printed resource requirements when boxed/inflatable/deployed parts are pre-assembled in the craft file.
// This only applies to vessel printing; said parts printed in the print shops will always be in the compacted form.
// Only specific part modules that alter the part mass are supported, including WBIPackingBox, WBIMultipurposeHab, and WBIMultipurposeLab.
// This patch file was specifically created for Pathfinder.
