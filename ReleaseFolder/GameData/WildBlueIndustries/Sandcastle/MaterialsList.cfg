	// NOTE: If you specify more than one RESOURCE, the sum of each resource's rate must be equal to or greater than 1.

		// The equation is: amountRequired = (partMass / resourceDensity) * rate
		// The multiplier cannot be less than 1. A value greater than 1 represents the resource that's wasted during construction.
		// Since Ore is a generic resource, it has a bunch of useless bits in it, so it generates more waste.
