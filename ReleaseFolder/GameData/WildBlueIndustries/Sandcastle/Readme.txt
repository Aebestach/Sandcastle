Changes

- The Quicksand and Sandcastle 3D print shops now have IVA variants that let you switch between horizontal and vertical orientations.
- In EVA Construction Mode, engineers can now switch part variants.
- In EVA Construction Mode, engineers can now change flags, set flag sizes, and toggle them on/off.
- If in timewarp, the print shop will now kill timewarp when all print jobs are done.
- The Sandcaster 3D Printer and EL-OCD Konstruction Manipulator are now available even when Extraplanetary Launchpads isn't installed.
- The Sandcaster 3D Printer and EL-OCD Konstruction Manipulator can now print a single part regardless of volume and drop it into space or onto the ground.
- The Sandcaster 3D Printer and EL-OCD Konstruction Manipulator can now print a vessel and drop it into space or onto the ground.
NOTE: Multiple Sandcasters/Konstruction Manipulators, whether on the same vessel or on a different vessel, can collaborate to finish the build.
- When printing vessels, the Sandcaster/Konstruction Manipulator can use pre-printed parts to reduce print time.
- The Sandcaster 3D Printer and EL-OCD Konstruction Manipulator can now recycle vessels. If there's room in the inventory, the recycler can store the recycled vessel's parts and if not, it will convert the part into raw resources.
NOTE: Multiple Sandcasters/Konstruction Manipulators, whether on the same vessel or on a different vessel, can collaborate to finish the recycling.
- Added a new Sandcastle game settings menu. It has things like a debug flag and the option to disable the check for kerbals occupying parts and vessels that are about to be recycled.
- Fixed EC smelter config - thanks Aelfh1m! :)

Wild Blue Core
- Added new ModuleInternalVariants - lets you switch IVA INTERNAL models.
- Added new ModuleAnimateGenericExtended - provides options for skill checks, requiring resources, and enabling/disabling part modules.
- Added new Settings menu, accessed through game settings.
