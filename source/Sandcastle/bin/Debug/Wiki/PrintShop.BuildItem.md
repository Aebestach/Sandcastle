            
Represents an item that needs to be built.
        
## Fields

### kBuildItemNode
Build item node identifier
### partName
Name of the part being built.
### availablePart
The Available part representing the build item.
### materials
List of resource materials required. Rate in this context represents the amount of the resource required in order to complete the part.
### requiredComponents
List of parts required to complete the build item. The parts must be in the vessel inventory.
### totalUnitsRequired
Total units required to produce the item, determined from all required resources.
### totalUnitsPrinted
Total units printed to date, determined from all required resources.
### isBeingRecycled
Flag indicating whether or not the part is being recycled.
### minimumGravity
The mininum gravity, in m/sec^2, that the part requires in order for the printer to print it. If set to 0, then the printer's vessel must be orbiting, sub-orbital, or on an escape trajectory, and not under acceleration. The default is -1, which ignores this requirement.
### minimumPressure
The minimum pressure, in kPA, that the part required in order for the printer to print it. If set to > 1, then the printer's vessel must be in an atmosphere or submerged. If set to 0, then the printer's vessel must be in a vacuum.
### removeResources
Determines whether or not the printer should remove the part's resources before placing the printed part in an inventory.
### variantIndex
Index of the part variant to use (if any).
